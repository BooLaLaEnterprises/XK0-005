# XK0-004
Course files for CompTIA Linux+ XK0-004

# What is this?
Tess Sluijter-Stek teaches the Linux+ curriculum, on Unixerius' behalf.

The classes in this Linux+ track include a large number of labs and exercises. We thought it could be beneficial to students world-wide, if we shared these exercises publicly.

# Future of this project
At the time of writing the next version of the Linux+ exam (XK0-005) is right around the corner. Tess will create an updated course, with additional labs, over the next few months.

When she's done, we'll create a new project for the new files.
