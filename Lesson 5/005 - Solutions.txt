= 005 - Solutions =

By request, here’s one set of possible solutions for the assignments in class 005. 

There is not one, single, right answer to any of these labs. The code below is the lowest effort, quick & dirty solutions I could give you. :) 

It’s literally too much to all put into a text file, so here’s a directory of files. 

You may find:
* NUM-name.sh = the quick solution
* NUM-name-improved.sh = the extra work
* NUM-name-testing.sh = a script which TESTS the solutions if they work

Remember: testing your work is very important!
