# Lesson plan

For the Linux+ class at IT Vitae, Tess has created a custom lesson plan with bespoke slides and lab exercises.

Next to this, we use the "Linux+ XK0-005" study guide by Blum and Bresnahan. ISBN 978-1-119-87896-4, [published by Wiley](https://www.wiley.com/en-be/CompTIA+Linux%2B+Study+Guide%3A+Exam+XK0+005%2C+5th+Edition-p-9781119878964).

Tess' lesson plan *does not* follow the order of chapters in the book, neither does it follow the CompTIA XK0-005 objectives. Instead, Tess tried to compile the learning materials in a sequence where classes build on the foundations laid in earlier classes.


## Objectives and class days

As mentioned, Tess follows a very different order from both CompTIA and Blum/Bresnahan. The following table explains which objectives are touched in which lesson.

| Lesson | Objective               | Topics                                                 |
